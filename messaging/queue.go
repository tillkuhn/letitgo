// Queue A queue is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only
// from one side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from
// the other side called the front. The queue data structure follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle,
// i.e. the element inserted at first in the list, is the first element to be removed from the list.
// The insertion of an element in a queue is called an enqueue operation and the deletion of an element
// is called a dequeue operation.

// This is generic (interface{}) but you can simply replace the type of the slice elements
// with something more concrete
